# StayHydrated – Water Intake Reminder App  

## 1. App Description  
**StayHydrated** is a simple Flutter mobile utility app that helps users calculate their recommended daily water intake based on **weight**, **activity level**, and **temperature**.  
It aims to promote healthy hydration habits through an easy-to-use interface, developed entirely using **Flutter’s built-in widgets** and **setState** for state updates.

## 2. Input → Process → Output  

### **Input**
- **Weight (kg):** via `TextField`  
- **Activity Level:** via `DropdownButtonFormField` (Light / Moderate / Active)  
- **Temperature:** via `DropdownButtonFormField` (Hot / Cold)  

### **Process**
The app calculates daily water intake using this simple logic:  
- **Water** = (weight × 0.033) + activityValue + temperatureValue
- where `activityValue` and `temperatureValue` are constants based on user selections.  

### **Output**
- Displays the **recommended water intake (in L/day)** below the **Calculate** button.  
- If inputs are invalid, a **red warning message** appears.

## 3. Widgets Used  
- **Text** – For headings, labels, and results  
- **TextField** – To input user weight  
- **DropdownButtonFormField** – For selecting activity level and temperature  
- **ElevatedButton** – To trigger calculation  
- **Column** and **Row** – For layout structure  
- **Container** – For spacing and padding  
- **Scaffold**, **AppBar**, **SizedBox**, **CircularProgressIndicator** – For home page structure and splash screen design  

---

## 4. Basic Validation Approach  
- Used `double.tryParse()` to safely convert text input to numbers.  
- If the user enters invalid or empty input, a **warning message** appears:  
  > "Please enter a valid weight."  
- Prevents crashes and avoids negative or zero weight inputs.  
- `setState()` is used to update both **warning** and **result messages** dynamically.
